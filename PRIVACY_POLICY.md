Privacy Policy
Reddnek built the Syncplay app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Reddnek at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection of no data.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Syncplay unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use

Using my service will not require you to disclose any personal information.

Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services.
I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information
through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or
Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your
parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
page.
