/*************************************************************************************************
 * Session wrapper class. It encapsulates all information and data we need about a session.
 *
 * In summary, a session is the status of the room, for example, the users in the room, properties
 * of the room (name, server, password, features...etc), as well as the shared playlist if there is
 * one or if it is activated in the first place.
 *
 * A protocol always exists with one session at a time. If a session changes (for example, changing
 * a room) then the session is overwritten and the protocol relaunches.
